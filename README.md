# SocialLite

A simple app that uses Firebase Authentication for sign up, sign in and sign out functionality. It also uses Firebase Realtime Database as a simple database.

The app's purpose is to be able to post to a timeline after logging into it similar to Twitter. Currently all users can see all other users posts. Also users can delete their own posts if desired by swiping on the cell containing their post.

To run the app simply clone this git repo and open the .xcodeproj file with XCode. It will then install all the necessary packages using SPM. After that the app should be good to go!
